# dogeX

## this repositery contains all the code for the dogeX project. This includes but is not limited to:

##### main projects

    - backend
    - frontend
    - solidity contracts

##### secondary projects

  - bots
    - buybot
  - misc
    - pfp generator
  
### manage.py

the manage.py file is the main entry point for the project. it has yet to be improved but it works this way:

'python manage.py run [service]' is the command to launch services ["bot", "frontend", "backend"]

some commands are filtered by their subservice:

- 'python manage.py run bot [subservice]' is the command to launch the bots (buybot)

The idea to create this is to simplify onoboarding of new freelancers on the project.

### each subprojects has their own README.md, read them if assigned a task on it.

### the KOCHI is using many different technologies, please don't modify anything in the subprojects you are not assigned in.
